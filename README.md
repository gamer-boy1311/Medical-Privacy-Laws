# PDR Network
* If you don't know who or what PDR Network is, or what services they offer to the public free of charge, an educator will be assigned to you immediately among the rest of the directory we possess within our files. The law is upgrading daily, and the laws of medicinal ruling changes and upgrades with the daily grind. General Services Agency has a group of specialty web-law designers refered to as 18F, and these are grouped into PDR Network, but stand independent as "American Coders." These people will be working with the PDR Network Pharmacist, the health educator who will contact you, in order to assure your clinic has a proper online webpage for online contact outside of a "business listing" because a clinic is not a business, it is a service. 

## Physician's Reference Desk
* Collaboration with the Walgreens' Dr. of pain medicine, and patient mental health status evaluation.

### Rx Relief Pharmacist: Master Chief of Education in Healthy Patient Law
* Here at PDR Network, we are a service provider of law for protecting the health of all U.S. citizens to the fullest of our potential. If a patient is experiencing abuse, neglect, or feels the health services provided to them by a specific provider is not of satisfactory in full, this then becomes a legal matter of which we abide by our means of motto to step in and correct any physicians who fall out of line. These services will subject any and all malpractice-driven physicians to a law that will be sentencing the MD to intensive training sessions that are suited specifically according to each single-standing primary care provider or doctor who has been pegged with a "c-flag" and then set-up with an appointment to be evaluated by one of our Naval Staff Educators of Health. Preferebly our main educator of medicinal law, Doctor Lacey Pedersen or MD Mark Pedersen.

# The Federal Government Case Worker:



## Contact Privacy
* Privacy is always a safety concern when working with a master-chief of health education. This is a deep concern of the federal government staff
whom are asigned to protect one another legally.

### Involvement With a Federal Health Educator
* Our lead of staffers is a highly trained prescriber of medicinal grade law for physical repair, and holds some of the highest degrees of service on volunteer basis accredidation for all walks of life and health. This achiever is a non-profiteer, and has been assigned to the company for investigational obligation of work in the field of research to aid the emergency crisis our VAD has been facing this past year of 2015, and has legitimate accredidational service hours invested into ACP_Advisor Net which is an online web-based service site that offers help to veterans seeking aid in times of hardship with all diverse ailments, from needing work all the way to homeless displacement, and even seeking help with pension-planning for retirement.
* Our lead of staff has several character-teachers upon which she is entiled to act with, and of, and as in team-player spirit to deal with providers seperately according to depth of severity needed for retraining. This is a legitimate process approved, backed, and recomended by the GSA, DoD, and the Attorney Genera of CA. These qualities are degree seperations in and for training leveling of self and physical self health as a whole, the teacher will supress your areas of lacking as a provider of pain management medication. If you are found unworthy of the right to prescribe pain medication after the first evalutaion with our educator; you will be stripped and suspended of your right to prescribe any and all pain medicine. If you have prior patients that are prescribed any pain medication, these patients will be taken care of by qualified staffers provided by the VA.

* A reminder to the provider involved, again, the VA is non-affiliated but is the only trustworthy, and qualified set of officials who can and will provide immediate care for all patients who are seemingly in danger of being trapped in crossfire of, and between the primary care provider and our prescriber of healthy patient law.

## Training with a Respiratory Doctor of Law
* Working with a lawyer and a doctor can be challenging, but this is not an insurmountable problem. Seeing the simplicity of working with a naval staff member of health education, will be overall beneficial and extremely satisfying to the client we become involved with. If you were not notified of this position of staff being assigned to you, by mail or e-mail, or phone contact by an official or the educator themself; that is because you are not open for paper-disclosure by "snail mail or U.S. post," and this is protected and backed by the USA No-Paper Act. Failure to recieve contact by e-mail, would be on you and behalf of your clinics' failure to supply an e-mail address in a viewable manor online as an open contact to the public or for your existing patients. This option will be a new C2 requirement installed with the educator's prescription plan by the end of 2015 to act for better primary-care giving communication with the health educator at all times on behalf of the patients at your clinic, in which we have connected you with through PDR Network.

### Law Prescription
* Prescription can be given by phone, e-mail, or in person at any time the educator comes into contact with the physician involved. This is a simple taskforce order taken on by our finest dr. to help update local CA-state clinical staff members on new C2 platform requirements for VA patients involved in protective status of preservation.

* Preserving the life of an individual:
This is something under a sensitive area of protection. The gray matter of this area is dangerous indeed, and this is where PDR Network Staff of Naval Educators and Federal American Coders have been enstated to step-up in protection of precious U.S. Citizens' lives. It has been brought to our attention that we are dealing with a serious pandemic of poachers that are seeking to bleed insurance benefits out of all covered U.S. persons with card coverages of all types. Due to the fact that this is highly unethical, and now, extremely illegal according to judicial court of Congress and their Senator of independent party. Researchers of all likes are now gathering specific sets of data, and one veteran owned business founder has sparked this broadened, endless fuel of research efforts in the name of empathetic value restoration within physicians practices; we have now fully enstated the leader as MCP_Independent [VOB] Clinical Research Company of Educational Training and Data.

* These efforts are at the fast-tracked pace
