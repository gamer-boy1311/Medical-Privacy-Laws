# PDR Network
* If you don't know who or what PDR Network is, or what services they offer to the public free of charge, an educator will be assigned to you immediately among the rest of the directory we possess within our files. The law is upgrading daily, and the laws of medicinal ruling changes and upgrades with the daily grind. General Services Agency has a group of specialty web-law designers refered to as 18F, and these are grouped into PDR Network, but stand independent as "American Coders." These people will be working with the PDR Network Pharmacist, the health educator who will contact you, in order to assure your clinic has a proper online webpage for online contact outside of a "business listing" because a clinic is not a business, it is a service. 

## Physician's Reference Desk
* Collaboration with the Walgreens' Dr. of pain medicine, and patient mental health status evaluation.

### Rx Relief Pharmacist: Master Chief of Education in Healthy Patient Law
* Here at PDR Network, we are a service provider of law for protecting the health of all U.S. citizens to the fullest of our potential. If a patient is experiencing abuse, neglect, or feels the health services provided to them by a specific provider is not of satisfactory in full, this then becomes a legal matter of which we abide by our means of motto to step in and correct any physicians who fall out of line. These services will subject any and all malpractice-driven physicians to a law that will be sentencing the MD to intensive training sessions that are suited specifically according to each single-standing primary care provider or doctor who has been pegged with a "c-flag" and then set-up with an appointment to be evaluated by one of our Naval Staff Educators of Health. Preferebly our main educator of medicinal law, Doctor Lacey Pedersen or MD Mark Pedersen.

# Immature Provider Actions

## Legal Penalty for Malpractice-Based Acts

### Illegal Stereotyping of Patients by Primary Care Provider:
* It is now fully illegal to stereotype any patients of the U.S. homeland. This falls into a diverse array of options that are listed by our penalty staffers, that are considered to be stereotypical actions of or against a patient, and this list will be sent out within the 3 month time-frame period as mentioned before. Here is the only place you will be able to view a full list of illegal stereotyping of patients in all.

### Bias Action of Stereotypers
* You are no longer allowed to drug test a patient without premission from a federal official or a DEA officer, after providing written or typed request with probable cause; no e-mail requests will be accepted outside of our health educator and prescriber, and this is the only contact who can grant you acceptance of a drug test kit, to test a patient after reviewing your request by e-mail and making phone-call contact with you on an appointed date.
* You will no longer be able to adjust the limit of pain medication in an attempt to lower the amount prescribed to a patient without the request of a higher, specifically authorized, and trained specialist of pain management, or Doctor Lacey Pedersen herself who can approve your patient's need to be lowered down slowly on each dose of pain medication until the patient is ready to end the pain medication treatment in all.
--- This is a personal choice of the patient to begin waning themselves off of a chronic pain medication, and is of no place of a primary care physician to decide the quality of life of a patient's needed basis for pain medication ingestion. This is crutial for purpose of the patients well being, overall. When a patient is ready or no longer in need of the aid of a prescribed pain medication, this can be openly discussed by or with their primary caregiver at the monthly or bi-monthly visit, but this is not advised for private discussion without a prescribing nurse of staff readily available to assist and or oversee that particular session of the conversation.

## Contact Privacy
* Privacy is always a safety concern when working with a master-chief of health education. This is a deep concern of the federal government staff
whom are asigned to protect one another legally.
* Due to the status we uphold here in our Naval Federal Government, our personel is the basis for getting the crisis handled and resolved as quickly and securely as possible; so we take immense pride in protecting all of our related officials. This is where privacy takes a turn on an immature "business" based clinic setting, whom abuses the name of medicine by lacking in ethic of actual legal privacy law enforcement, not to mention acting as a place of business instead of a true service providing residence. These are residences because they house persons in need of health care, even if its implied that temporary service is a clinic-basis of care, this is inadequate by judicial courts eye of law provision to the public. The court finds fault within the hollow thought process that becomes stereotypically melded to a primary care clinic, and any clinical residence outside of a hospital of emergency providers.
This comes into context when you think of the "care" in "primary caregiver," and this will boost the need for services actually provided by a clinic. Upgrades will come with the next 3 months of service and continue on into 2018, after this we hope to have the problem under complete control; or nearing resolvement. 

### Involvement With a Federal Health Educator
* Our lead of staffers is a highly trained prescriber of medicinal grade law for physical repair, and holds some of the highest degrees of service on volunteer basis accredidation for all walks of life and health. This achiever is a non-profiteer, and has been assigned to the company for investigational obligation of work in the field of research to aid the emergency crisis our VAD has been facing this past year of 2015, and has legitimate accredidational service hours invested into ACP_Advisor Net which is an online web-based service site that offers help to veterans seeking aid in times of hardship with all diverse ailments, from needing work all the way to homeless displacement, and even seeking help with pension-planning for retirement.
* Our lead of staff has several character-teachers upon which she is entiled to act with, and of, and as in team-player spirit to deal with providers seperately according to depth of severity needed for retraining. This is a legitimate process approved, backed, and recomended by the GSA, DoD, and the Attorney Genera of CA. These qualities are degree seperations in and for training leveling of self and physical self health as a whole, the teacher will supress your areas of lacking as a provider of pain management medication. If you are found unworthy of the right to prescribe pain medication after the first evalutaion with our educator; you will be stripped and suspended of your right to prescribe any and all pain medicine. If you have prior patients that are prescribed any pain medication, these patients will be taken care of by qualified staffers provided by the VA.

* A reminder to the provider involved, again, the VA is non-affiliated but is the only trustworthy, and qualified set of officials who can and will provide immediate care for all patients who are seemingly in danger of being trapped in crossfire of, and between the primary care provider and our prescriber of healthy patient law.

## Training with a Respiratory Doctor of Law
* Working with a lawyer and a doctor can be challenging, but this is not an insurmountable problem. Seeing the simplicity of working with a naval staff member of health education, will be overall beneficial and extremely satisfying to the client we become involved with. If you were not notified of this position of staff being assigned to you, by mail or e-mail, or phone contact by an official or the educator themself; that is because you are not open for paper-disclosure by "snail mail or U.S. post," and this is protected and backed by the USA No-Paper Act. Failure to recieve contact by e-mail, would be on you and behalf of your clinics' failure to supply an e-mail address in a viewable manor online as an open contact to the public or for your existing patients. This option will be a new C2 requirement installed with the educator's prescription plan by the end of 2015 to act for better primary-care giving communication with the health educator at all times on behalf of the patients at your clinic, in which we have connected you with through PDR Network.

### Law Prescription
* Prescription can be given by phone, e-mail, or in person at any time the educator comes into contact with the physician involved. This is a simple taskforce order taken on by our finest dr. to help update local CA-state clinical staff members on new C2 platform requirements for VA patients involved in protective status of preservation.

* Preserving the life of an individual:
This is something under a sensitive area of protection. The gray matter of this area is dangerous indeed, and this is where PDR Network Staff of Naval Educators and Federal American Coders have been enstated to step-up in protection of precious U.S. Citizens' lives. It has been brought to our attention that we are dealing with a serious pandemic of poachers that are seeking to bleed insurance benefits out of all covered U.S. persons with card coverages of all types. Due to the fact that this is highly unethical, and now, extremely illegal according to judicial court of Congress and their Senator of independent party. Researchers of all likes are now gathering specific sets of data, and one veteran owned business founder has sparked this broadened, endless fuel of research efforts in the name of empathetic value restoration within physicians practices; we have now fully enstated the leader as MCP_Independent [VOB] Clinical Research Company of Educational Training and Data.

* These efforts are at the fast-tracked pace
