## Contact Privacy
* Privacy is always a safety concern when working with a master-chief of health education. This is a deep concern of the federal government staff
whom are asigned to protect one another legally.

## Training with a Respiratory Doctor of Law
* Working with a lawyer and a doctor can be challenging, but this is not and unsurmountable problem. Seeing the simplicity of working with a naval staff member, will be overall beneficial and extremely satisfying to the client we become involved with. If you were not notified of this position of staff being asigned to you, by mail or e-mail, or phone contact by an official or the educator themself; that is because you are not open for paper-disclosure, and this is protected and backed by the USA No-Paper Act. Failure to recieve contact by e-mail, would be on behalf of the clinics' failure to supply an e-mail address for open contact to the public. This option shall be a new requirement installed with the educator's prescription for better primary-care giving on behalf of the patients at the clinic we have contacted.

### Law Prescription
* Prescription can be given by phone, e-mail, or in person at any time the educator comes into contact with the physician involved. This is a simple taskforce order taken on by our finest dr. to help update local CA-state clinical staff members on new C2 platform requirements for VA patients involved in protective status of preservation.
* Preserving the life of an individual:
This is something under a sensitive area of protection. The gray matter of this area.
