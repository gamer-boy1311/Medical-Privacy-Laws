## Contact Privacy
* Privacy is always a safety concern when working with a master-chief of health education. This is a deep concern of the federal government staff

## Training with a Respiratory Doctor of Law
* Working with a lawyer and a doctor can be challenging, but this is not an insurmountable problem. Seeing the simplicity of working with a naval staff member of health education, will be overall beneficial and extremely satisfying to the client we become involved with. If you were not notified of this position of staff being assigned to you, by mail or e-mail, or phone contact by an official or the educator themself; that is because you are not open for paper-disclosure by "snail mail or U.S. post," and this is protected and backed by the USA No-Paper Act. Failure to recieve contact by e-mail, would be on you and behalf of your clinics' failure to supply an e-mail address in a viewable manor online as an open contact to the public or for your existing patients. This option will be a new C2 requirement installed with the educator's prescription plan by the end of 2015 to act for better primary-care giving communication with the health educator at all times on behalf of the patients at your clinic, in which we have connected you with through PDR Network.

### Law Prescription
* Prescription can be given by phone, e-mail, or in person at any time the educator comes into contact with the physician involved. This is a simple taskforce order taken on by our finest dr. to help update local CA-state clinical staff members on new C2 platform requirements for VA patients involved in protective status of preservation.

This is something under a sensitive area of protection. The gray matter of this area.
